## Lalitha Trishati Lyrics in Tamil with Meaning and Translation
 
The Lalitha Trishati lyrics in Tamil are given below along with their meaning and translation in English. The lyrics are divided into three parts: the nyasa, the stotram and the namavali. The nyasa is a ritual invocation that prepares the devotee for the recitation of the hymn. The stotram is a poetic composition that glorifies the goddess and her various forms and manifestations. The namavali is a list of 300 names that describe the goddess's attributes and functions.
 
The nyasa begins with the salutation to the sage Hayagriva, who is the seer of this hymn, and to Goddess Lalitha Devi, who is the deity of this hymn. It also mentions the meter, the seed syllable, the power syllable and the pin syllable of this hymn. It also states the purpose of chanting or reading this hymn, which is to attain the four-fold aims of human life: dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), kama (desire) and moksha (liberation). The nyasa also includes the gestures of touching various parts of the body with different fingers and uttering different syllables to invoke the presence of the goddess in oneself.
 
The stotram begins with Agastya's request to Hayagriva to teach him something more than the Lalitha Sahasranama, which he has already learned from him. Hayagriva hesitates because he has been instructed by Goddess Lalitha herself not to reveal the most secret hymn called Lalitha Trishati to anyone. However, Goddess Lalitha appears before Hayagriva and asks him to teach Agastya this hymn out of her grace and love for him. She tells him that this hymn is more secret than the Lalitha Sahasranama and that it can fulfill all desires and grant all boons. She also tells him that Agastya is worthy of receiving this hymn because he is a devoted worshipper of her and her husband Kameshwara. She also praises Agastya for his patience and devotion in waiting for three years without uttering a word while Hayagriva was silent. She then gives him permission to teach Agastya this hymn.
 
The namavali consists of 300 names of Goddess Lalitha Devi, each starting with one of the 15 letters that form the Panchadashi mantra, which is the essence of Sri Vidya. The Panchadashi mantra is Ka-aa-ee-la-hrim Ha-sa-ka-ha-la-hrim Sa-ka-la-hrim. The first five letters (vaag bhava koota) originate from the Mooladhara chakra (the root center), which is situated below the vertebral column. This chakra represents the baser instincts in man. The second six letters (kama raja koota) start from the Anahata chakra (the heart center), which represents love and compassion. The third four letters (shakti koota) start from the Ajna chakra (the third eye center), which represents intuition and wisdom. The last letter (hreem) represents Goddess Lalitha herself, who pervades all these centers and beyond.
 
The 300 names describe various aspects of Goddess Lalitha Devi, such as her beauty, her power, her grace, her compassion, her wisdom, her bliss, her playfulness, her creativity, her sovereignty, her protection, her manifestation, her transcendence and so on. Each name has a deep meaning and significance that can be understood by meditating on it with devotion and faith.
